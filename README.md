Car Rental Website built using Next.js 14+ and Sanity CMS. It provides a seamless platform for users to browse, rent, and manage cars efficiently. The website features a user-friendly interface, allowing customers to explore detailed car listings, check availability, and make bookings. Users can also view their order history and track the status of their rentals.

The backend is powered by Sanity CMS, enabling robust CRUD operations for managing car details, rental data, and user interactions. The system ensures real-time updates, maintaining accurate stock levels and order records. With a professional design and functionality focus, the project aims to deliver a reliable, user-centric car rental experience.

The platform also emphasizes scalability and future enhancements, such as adding dynamic filtering, advanced shipment tracking, and comprehensive analytics to meet the evolving needs of the car rental industry.
